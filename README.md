Just following the guide from GitHub
Little bit about myself:
Started off my career in the carpenter trade, however I did not like the fact that, once winter came, it would get slow. Hence, I decided to take a career change, I looked into several other trades and professions, but coding was the one that got my attention. After several tutorials on Youtube, I decided to try some courses on Udemy, I did realize I needed more of a one-on-one instructions. I then saw Team Treehouse and I've been learning from their 'Tracks' for the past two weeks. Overall, I've been coding for about a month now. It's hard to see my progress, but I keep reminding myself that through time and practice I will understand it.
